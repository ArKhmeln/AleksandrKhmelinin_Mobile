5.	Modify existing tests to run on a real device. What should be changed?

Capabilities (deviceName) should be changed  both in property files and Appium inspector.


6.	Connect a real device to Appium (describe required actions) and run tests. Are there any difference with run
on emulator?

Required actions:
Enable developers options, usb debugging etc, connect device to PC via USB, start Appium server, start Inspector
session, fill in capabilities (deviceName, platformName, browserName, app), click "Start Session".
"DeviceName" in property file should have appropriate letters instead of "emulator-5554".

Differences:

I had to update Chrome in emulator because of error. Also there were some annoying pop-ups like "Welcome to Chrome"
In Chrome on a real device "Choose search engine" was displayed while running web test and all previous tabs were closed,
settings have been reset.
