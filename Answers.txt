1.	Change settings to run web test on a certain iOS device in mobile cloud. Run test with your changes. Did test pass?

Yes, it did.

3.	 Run test with your changes. Did test pass?

Yes, if app is installed on cloud device.

4.	Try to use autoLaunch capability with app as before instead of appPackage and appActivity. Does this approach work?

This capability is already set to true dy default. Adding it as desired capability without appPackage and appActivity
leads to Exception "Original error: The desired capabilities must include either: app, appPackage or browserName, sessionId:null."

8.	Whatâ€™s wrong with our code? How to fix/improve it? Implement your suggestions.

I've implemented Page Object Pattern for ContactManager test just for training despite it's a pattern for pattern here.
