5.	Modify existing tests to run on a real device. What should be changed?
Capabilities (deviceName) should be changed in DriverSetup and Appium inspector both.


6.	Connect a real device to Appium (describe required actions) and run tests. Are there any difference with run
on emulator?
Required actions:
Enable developers options, usb debugging etc, connect device to PC via USB, start Appium server, start Inspector
session, fill in capabilities (deviceName, platformName, browserName, app), click "Start Session".
Differences:
I had to update Chrome in emulator because of error. Also there were some annoying pop-ups.
Appium Settings have been installed while smartphone was connected through the appium for the first time. It launches
every time i run tests. In Chrome with website loading pops up "Choose search engine".
